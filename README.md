# Sentiment Analysis of Indian Elections

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the sentiment surrounding the Indian elections by examining tweets, news articles, and public opinions. Utilizing a combination of natural language processing tools and techniques, the project provides insights into the public sentiment towards different political figures and parties involved in the elections.

## Technologies Used
- **Numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **TextBlob**: For performing sentiment analysis.
- **Plotly**: (both `graph_objects` and `express`) For visualizing the data and sentiment analysis results.

## Setup and Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can then install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas textblob plotly
```

For TextBlob, you might also need to download some additional data. Run the following Python commands after installation:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
nltk.download('brown')
```

## How to Use
1. **Data Collection**: Collect tweets, news articles, and public opinions regarding the Indian elections. This part of the process depends on your data source (e.g., Twitter API for tweets).

2. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the collected data for analysis. This might involve removing stopwords, stemming, and lemmatization.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Use TextBlob to perform sentiment analysis on the preprocessed data. This will involve calculating sentiment polarity scores to understand the general sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) towards the subjects.

4. **Data Visualization**: Use Plotly to visualize the sentiment analysis results. This can include creating bar charts or scatter plots to display the distribution of sentiments across different political figures or over time.

## Example Code Snippet
Here's a basic example of how to perform sentiment analysis on a piece of text using TextBlob:

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

text = "The election campaign by the party was incredibly successful and well-received."
blob = TextBlob(text)
print(blob.sentiment)
```

## Visualization Example
To visualize the results, you can use Plotly. Here's an example of creating a simple bar chart:

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go

fig = go.Figure(data=[
    go.Bar(name='Positive', x=['Party A', 'Party B'], y=[20, 14]),
    go.Bar(name='Negative', x=['Party A', 'Party B'], y=[12, 18])
])

fig.update_layout(barmode='group')
fig.show()
```
