# Sentiment Analysis of Indian Elections: Modi vs. Rahul

## Project Overview
This project dives into a sentiment analysis of pre-collected Twitter data regarding Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi, leading figures in the Indian elections. Leveraging Python, alongside prominent Natural Language Processing (NLP) and visualization libraries, this endeavor sifts through tweets to categorize sentiments into positive, negative, or neutral. This README outlines the project including its setup, execution instructions, and the insights it aims to provide.

### Objectives
- Process and analyze pre-collected Twitter data concerning Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi.
- Categorize tweet sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Compare sentiment distribution between the two political figures.
- Visualize the analysis results for intuitive comparative insights.

## Technologies Used
This project makes extensive use of the following technologies:
- **Python 3.x**: The core programming language used.
- **NLP Library**: TextBlob for easy text processing and sentiment analysis.
- **Data Handling**: Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numerical Operations**: NumPy for numerical calculations.
- **Visualization**: Plotly (both `graph_objects` and `express` modules) for creating interactive and static visualizations.

## Setup and Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jafararalikhan/
cd NLP-Project-Sentiment-Analysis-of--indian-Elections
```

2. **Install the necessary Python libraries**:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas textblob plotly
```

## Data
The dataset comprises pre-collected Twitter data related to Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi, stored in a format suitable for analysis (e.g., CSV). (You might want to add more details about the dataset, such as how many tweets it contains or any preprocessing steps you took.)

## Running the Project

To execute the sentiment analysis, navigate to the project directory and run:

```python
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

*Note: Replace `sentiment_analysis.py` with the actual name of your Python script.*

## Results

Discuss the project's findings here, possibly including the overall sentiment towards each politician, notable data trends, and what these trends could suggest about public opinion at the time of the elections.

## Visualization

The project utilizes Plotly for dynamic and engaging visualizations. Comparative sentiment analysis results are presented through bar charts, showcasing the distribution of sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) towards Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi.
